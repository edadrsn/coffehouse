                <p>Turkish coffee is a big part of the culture in Turkey and it’s a custom they hold dear. The country’s
                    so enamoured with the beverage that the Turkish word for breakfast ‘kahvalti’, literally means
                    ‘before coffee’, and the word for brown ‘kahverengi’ means coffee coloured.
                    Steeped in lore and rich history, Turkish coffee is far more than a morning drink, it’s full of
                    tradition that’s been carried down through the ages from ancestor to ancestor. In fact, Turkish
                    coffee is so unique that it was inscribed to Unesco’s Intangible Culture Heritage List in 2013, due
                    to the unique practices that goes into the preparation and presentation
                </p>
                <img src="images/turkıshcoffee1.webp">
                <p>The roots of Turkish coffee trace all the way back to 1555, when it was brought to Istanbul by Syrian
                    traders. Then, by the mid-17th century, it became an essential part of the Ottoman Court’s
                    ceremonies and the Sultan would be served ceremonious coffee by his own personal coffee makers.

                    Certain historical coffee rituals also became a part of marriage, where women would receive training
                    on brewing Turkish coffee and potential suitors would judge her depending on how well she could make
                    the traditional beverage. Interestingly, in today’s world, elements of this custom still remain and
                    its customary when a woman’s hand in marriage is asked for, for the bride to be to prepare and serve
                    coffee for her family and potential husband. The story goes that if she brews it properly, she’s
                    ready to be married.

                    Coffeehouses came to Turkey around five centuries ago, beginning in the Tahtakale neighbourhood.
                    These places began as social gathering spots, strictly for men, with women typically enjoying the
                    drink at home. The coffeehouses of Turkey were also an important part of preserving the country’s
                    oral history, as they were places of storytelling and folklore during the Ottoman Empire.</p>

                <img src="images/turkıshcoffee2.webp">
                <p>Typically, Turkish coffee comes from the Arabica bean – but it’s so much more than that. The true
                    meaning of Turkish coffee comes from the unusual method of creating the beverage.
                    To start, the beans need to be ground to a fine powder with either a pestle and mortar or more
                    traditionally, a Turkish coffee grinder.
                    Then, the beans get added to a copper pot known as a ‘cezve’ which contains cold, filtered water, if
                    sugar is wanted, then this will get added at this stage too (sugar is never added afterwards as it
                    will disturb the grounds at the bottom of the cup).
                    Once these steps are complete, the pot gets put on a medium heat until it simmers and the liquid
                    starts to foam, once this has happened, it gets taken off the heat and stirred. The cezve will then
                    be added back onto the heat and this step will be repeated a few times until the liquid is thick in
                    the traditional Turkish coffee way.
                    When the brew is finished, the pot will be left to cool for a minute, allowing the grounds to fall
                    to the bottom. </p>

            <p>For espresso, boiled hot water must pass through extremely finely ground coffee powder at high pressure.
                A strainer is used instead of a filter. Thus, nothing of the aromatic flavor of the coffee oil is lost.
                As a result, coffee with a strong and intense flavor is obtained.</p>

                    stability before meeting-filled mornings and chaotic travel days. While it's easy to order the same
                    espresso drink day after day (for me, that means an Americano with oat milk), there's something to
                    be said for venturing out of your caffeinated comfort zone and learning about variations on what you
                    know and love. Once you've invested in a good espresso machine, bought some coffee beans you're
                    excited about, and stocked up on the best espresso cups, read on to learn how to make six of the
                    most iconic espresso drinks from the comfort of your own home.

                <img src="images/espresso3.jpeg">
                <p>
                    The espresso was then invented in Venice, Italy back in the early 20th century. The drink was
                    created by businessman Luigi Bezzera who was experimenting with coffee to see how he could make his
                    brew faster.In 1903, he owned a manufacturing business, and it was frustrating him that making a cup
                    of coffee would take up so much time. Later, after some experimenting, he discovered that adding
                    steam pressure to the machine not only cut the time it took to create the brew, but it also created
                    a much stronger drink.
                    The new process drew out all of the best qualities of the coffee beans and Bezzera quickly named the
                    machine “Fast Coffee Machine”. As the Italian word ‘espresso’ translates to fast in English, the
                    name of the brew originated from the first machine.
                    Unfortunately for Bezzera, while he was very smart and ahead of his time by creating the “Fast
                    Coffee Machine”, his talents in marketing weren’t so successful.

                    Soon after his invention, in 1905, he met with Desidero Pavoni who purchased part of the machine’s
                    rights from Bezzera, and then had it patented. Almost immediately, Pavoni’s name became associated
                    with the espresso.

                    So, even though Bezzera was the original inventor of the ever-famous brew, it is, in fact, Pavoni
                    that changed the way we drink coffee due to his marketing expertise.

                    1900s, whiskey milkshakes were replaced for ones made with flavored syrups and malted milk

                <p> For something so tasty, the history is brief. The word “milkshake” was first printed in 1885, but it
                    wasn’t for the kid-friendly treat we think of today. Instead, the first milkshakes were a

                    ones made with flavored syrups and malted milk.

                    It wasn’t until 1922 when ice cream milkshakes became common, when Walgreens began advertising
                    malted milkshakes after employee Ivar "Pop" Coulson began adding vanilla ice cream, an addition that
                    was an immediate hit. Milkshake rose in popularity and ice cream machines delivered the consistency
                    we think of today.

                    And now, milkshakes have seemingly endless customizable options, from thickness to flavor to
                    toppings. Drugstore soda fountains offer a nostalgic sip of a chocolate or vanilla milkshake while

                    The only difference between a smoothie, which is a drink like ice slush and milk shake, is that it
                    does not contain added sugar. Smoothies, which have a filling feature, are also frequently consumed
                    by athletes. Those who exercise regularly can add protein powder to this drink. Blender or smoothie
                    machines can be used to make smoothies, which are also popular on diet lists.

                    If you are going to add ice, your blender must have strong blades. Smoothie is not a drink that can
                    be made without using a blender. Hand blenders also do not have enough power to crush ice. For a
                    delicious and smooth smoothie, you should use a stand blender model.

                    If you do not have enough space in your kitchen, you can choose practical smoothie machines with
                    minimalist designs instead of these products. You can make this delicious drink with any fruit and
                    vegetable you can think of. You can serve your smoothies with Karaca soft drink glasses. You can try
                    one of the vitamin and mineral rich smoothie recipes or create your own recipe.

                <p>Now that we understand what an Irish coffee is, let's explore its origins and where it comes from.
                    While the idea of ​​alcoholic hot coffee has been around for a while, it dates back to the
                    mid-nineteenth century in Viennese, German, and Danish coffeehouses. Irish coffee is said to have
                    been first created by Joe Sheridan, a chef in Foynes Port near Limerick, Ireland, in the 1940s.
                    In 1943, a Pan Am flying boat flight bound for New York was turned back to Foynes due to bad weather
                    conditions. Sheridan was asked to return to the airport and prepare hot food and drinks for
                    passengers feeling the winter weather. Sheridan prepared a mixture to warm the passengers. When an
                    American passenger asked if this blend was Brazilian coffee, Sheridan replied that it was Irish
                    coffee.
                    In 1951, travel writer Stanton Delaplane sampled Sheridan's Irish Coffee at Foynes Airport. He
                    introduced this new coffee to Jack Koeppler, the owner of the Buena Vista hotel, and asked him to
                    recreate it. However, after many tries it still wasn't quite right.
                    This encouraged Koeppler to visit the source itself and learn exactly how to make this coffee. He
                    went to Joe Sheridan in Limerick, Ireland, to learn the proper way to make this coffee.
                    On his return, Koeppler perfected the recipe that is still used in Buena Vista today. Sheridan was
                    also offered a job in Buena Vista and settled in San Francisco and worked in Buena Vista for ten
                    years.

                <p>When asked 'what is Irish coffee' it is not always easy to get an accurate answer as there are many
                    variations of this coffee drink, often with the same name. In Spain, Irish coffee may be served with
                    a bottom layer of whiskey, a separate layer of coffee, and a layer of cream on top. Usually, special
                    devices are used to do this. In Southeast Asia, you may sometimes find iced coffee and whiskey
                    cocktail without cream served under the name "Irish coffee" . Welsh coffee is very similar to Irish
                    coffee, but uses Scotch whiskey instead of Irish whiskey. And in Russia, vodka is used instead of
                    Irish whiskey.</p>

                <p>Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during World War II. Soldiers
                    would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther. The water dilutes the espresso
                    while still maintaining a high level of caffeine.

                <img src="images/americano1.webp">
                <p>A classic Americano calls for just two ingredients: a shot of espresso and somewhere between eight
                    and 12 ounces of hot water. You can also make an Americano coffee with a double shot of espresso;
                    just know that you’ll need to adjust the ratio of water accordingly to keep the drink balanced. The
                    order of operations is up to the maker –– you can add hot water to the espresso, or espresso to the
                    hot water, the latter of which makes for what’s often referred to as a Long Black. “Our preferred
                    way of making these drinks is to add hot water to the cup first, and then to brew the espresso over
                    the water to prefer the crema,” explains Wong. “A long black is hot water first with espresso
                    floated on top to preserve the crema. An Americano could be made in either order, but our preference
                    is to add the espresso to the water after.”While some caffeinated drinks mask or dilute the flavor
                    of beans with syrups, spices, or milk, the Americano’s simplicity makes it especially worthwhile to
                    use high-quality beans.

                    Caffé Latte, of Italian origin, is consumed all over the world today. So how to make Caffé Latte?
                    Caffé Latte is made by adding milk to espresso. First of all, we start making normal espresso. A
                    single espresso is prepared from freshly ground coffee (7-9 g recommended) and then the milk is
                    heated using the steam method (70-72 degrees is recommended). The milk, which has heated up and
                    turned into cream, is poured over the prepared espresso. Caffé Latte is ready to drink. (1/7 milk
                    coffee ratio is the accepted range)
                    In addition to the classic espresso machine, you can get coffees that taste close to the
                    professional Latte flavor by adding milk to the coffees you prepare with the help of Moka Pot and
                    Minipresso.</p>

                    early 1990s. In northern Europe and Scandinavia, a similar "trend" started in the early 1980s as

                    through the centimeter-long hole of a plastic cup. This foam needs room to breathe.

                    the hoods worn by the monks, nuns, and friars of the Capuchin order. The cappuccino itself evolved
                    since the 17th century from coffee with a bit of milk to the petite foamy drink it is today.

                    ice. It can be prepared by the shaking method, also known as shaken. In addition, it can be made
                    ready to serve by pounding and mixing. Its most interesting feature is that it is not a liquid
                    coffee; On the contrary, it appears with an extremely dense structure.

                    In places that sell coffee, you can see that those prepared on this basis are offered by blending
                    them with different flavors. Some are even mixed and served with tea. However, you will see that it
                    is made with coffee in many places. If you haven't tried it before, we definitely recommend you to

                    into a shaker and shake the mixture to create a frothy layer on top. Don't be surprised if you hear
                    that in Bulgaria, frappé is made with soda instead of water. While in Denmark they use water instead
                    of milk, in Serbia they make frappé with milk or ice cream and top it with fresh whipped cream. One
                    of the most distinctive varieties of frappé is in Boston. In fact, a type of milkshake made with ice
                    cream is simply called "frap" here. In short, if you are a frappé lover, enjoy discovering the

                    Thessaloniki International Fair held in Greece in 1957. According to what is said; A representative
                    from Nestlé was demonstrating how to make an instant chocolate drink for children, based on
                    chocolate added to milk and then shaken in a shaker. A Nestlé employee noticed that there was no hot
                    water left to make coffee during a break. Thereupon, he mixed the instant coffee granules with cold
                    water and ice cubes and shook them in a shaker bowl, and the modern frappé was born. Still
                    incredibly popular in Greece, you can find this frappé recipe in most cafes across the country.</p>

                <p>Macchiato is a coffee prepared with a small amount of milk foam in an espresso machine and consumed
                    hot. Macchiato, an Italian classic, takes its name from the milk foam placed on espresso, which
                    makes it lighter. Since the milk foam looks like a stain or spot on the espresso, this coffee is
                    called macchiato, which means 'stained, spotted' in Italian. Moreover, the white milk stain on the
                    espresso is called espresso macchiato, and the stain left by the brown espresso on the milk is
                    called latte macchiato. Other names used to name macchiato coffee are caffé macchiato and espresso
                    macchiato.The first requirement for a delicious Italian macchiato is that the coffee beans have been
                    stored correctly, roasted and freshly ground. The classic macchiato recipe consists of two stages:
                    espresso and milk foam making. It is important that the machine you will use to make espresso is
                    clean. Because the residues on the machine heads make the taste of espresso harsher.

                    a café pingado or coffee with a drop of milk.</p>

                <p>Mocha coffee is a sweet and aromatic type of coffee prepared with espresso, milk and chocolate syrup
                    or powder. This coffee, named after Yemen's Moka port, has an important place in the coffee trade.
                    Mocha coffee is rich in ingredients such as caffeine and antioxidants. However, mocha coffee is also
                    a drink high in sugar and calories. Therefore, it is also important to consume this drink carefully.

                <p>In fact, "mocha" is a type of coffee made from a specific type of coffee bean that grows only in
                    Mokka, Yemen. Over time, the mixture of coffee and chocolate (or a similar sweetening flavor) began
                    to be called mocha. The taste of mocha is likened to chocolate coffee. Even if we accept this as
                    true, mocha is much more than that. The sharp taste offered by the espresso shot combines with the
                    sweetness of chocolate and turns into a velvety, soft-drinking, enjoyable taste.</p>

                    Much like a pour over, drip coffee is made by pouring hot water over coffee grounds that are safely
                    nestled in a filter. As the coffee brews, it drips (hence the name) into a coffee pot below.
                    Depending on the size of the machine, you can make up to fourteen cups in one go, or opt for a small
                    coffee maker to brew a single serving.

                <p>Different brewing methods rely on different coffee grounds. For example, espresso uses very fine
                    grounds so that they fully extract under the espresso machine’s high pressure. On the flip side,
                    drip coffee machines can use a slightly coarser grind. The trick to excellent drip coffee is freshly
                    grinding the beans. “[Grinding your own coffee beans] significantly influences the flavor profile.
                    Coffee experiences oxidation, akin to an apple turning brown after being bitten and exposed to air,”
                    says Kawahara. “By grinding beans freshly, the inherent flavors are more pronounced.” If you are
                    using pre-ground coffee, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. </p>

                    Spreading step by step from Spain to the world, cortado is consumed by more and more people in our

                    of milk on top of double shot espresso, is prepared by some people by adding the same amount of
                    frothy milk instead of milk. Thus, the amount of milk in the coffee is further reduced.

                <p>Flat white coffee is among the coffees that have become increasingly popular lately. Because of the
                    different preparation methods of lattes and the similarities between lattes and flat white coffees,
                    flat white is often incorrectly described as the "smaller version of the latte." It's true that
                    lattes, cappuccinos and flat whites consist primarily of steamed milk and espresso.
                    However, different factors such as the amount of coffee, the preparation process of the milk, and
                    the methods used to add the milk make the brews vary greatly. Although it looks like a small latte,
                    it is a type of coffee that requires technical knowledge and mastery to make. Flat white is
                    considered one of the special coffees that offer a pleasant drink due to its unique texture.</p>

                <p>In its most basic definition, flat white coffee; It is coffee made with micro-frothed milk poured
                    over one or two shots of espresso to create an elegant and velvety texture.

                    Exactly where it started to be made is a controversial issue. According to The Telegraph newspaper,
                    although the origin of flat white coffee is accepted as Australia, New Zealanders claim that flat
                    white belongs to them.

                    New Zealanders claim that flat white coffee was first invented by Derek Townsend at DKF Café in
                    1984. Australians say the real person who discovered flat white was Fraser McInnes, who coined the
                    term flat white at Café Bodega in 1989 to describe a cappuccino with incorrectly prepared foam.

                    Although it is not known for sure which country discovered this brewing style first, it is known
                    that both countries started consuming this new type of coffee at the same time.</p>
